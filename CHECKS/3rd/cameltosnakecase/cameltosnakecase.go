/**
Write a function that converts a string from camelCase to snake_case.

If the string is empty, return an empty string.
If the string is not camelCase, return the string unchanged.
If the string is camelCase, return the snake_case version of the string.
For this exercise you need to know that camelCase has two different writing alternatives that will be accepted:

lowerCamelCase
UpperCamelCase
Rules for writing in camelCase:

The word does not end on a capitalized letter (CamelCasE).
No two capitalized letters shall follow directly each other (CamelCAse).
Numbers or punctuation are not allowed in the word anywhere (camelCase1).

//we need a function to check if contains only alphabet
//we need a function to check for upper case
//function to convert from camel to snake case.
